# plant-disease-detection
This project aims to classify various plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The dataset used is the "New Plant Diseases Dataset" sourced from Kaggle, which includes a diverse collection of plant images. The dataset is structured into training and validation, with images categorized by specific plant diseases.

### Key Features:
- **Data Loading**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for efficient data loading and preprocessing.
- **Model Training**: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: Provides classification metrics to assess model performance.
### Dataset Structure:
- **train**: Contains training images organized by class.
- **valid**: Contains validation images organized by class.
- **test**: Contains test images for final evaluation.
### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
